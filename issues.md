//count frequency of expense and store in array
if an item has the same count of frequency as another for example 
water was entered twice and apple was entered twice the second entry would be noted as the most frequent

^^^^^
FIX   

change maxCount to 1 to check if expense is recorded in arrary more than once  (basically two entries more or greater) so the entry amount would have to be one more greater than the previous maxCOunt to equal maxCount
